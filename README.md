# Messy Data Cleanup
Performed data cleaning on the 2023 Ask A Manager Salary Survey responses.<br/><br/>
**Skills:** Data Cleaning <br/>
**Tools:** Python and its libraries - Pandas, NumPy, RegEx.

## Scenario
The [responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ioUjhnz6ywSpEbARI-G3RoPyO0NRBqrJnWf-7C_eirs/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1854892322#gid=1854892322) to the [Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2023](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10sn2XFmvjtRxrw7vedkpSp3cAd2kvKrOjnqHpeUXl4U/viewform?edit_requested=true) are informative but inconsistent, suffering from missing data, formatting inconsistencies, and unstandardized categories. My goal is to clean and standardize the dataset so it becomes complete, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis.
